# Rationalizing WordPress


## CMS adoption at UF
### Overall

* **WordPress** powers **over 90%** of all UF production CMS sites (**over 2,000**).
* **TerminalFour** powers **less than 10%** of all UF production CMS sites (**over 200**).

### Among the 16 colleges

* WordPress – 81.25%
* TerminalFour – 12.5%
* Other – 6.25%

### ICT customers

* WordPress – 48
* TerminalFour – 26
* Other – 74

### TerminalFour growth over the last 3 years
* 230 sites in 2017
* 264 sites in 2018 (increase of 34 sites in 1 year)
* 275 sites in 2019 (increase of 9 sites in 1 year)

## Drag and drop page builder
**A drag and drop page builder is a huge innovative technological shift.** Such functionality makes it easy to build complex layouts that would otherwise be impossible.

* **Advanced editing tools.** It enhances and modernizes the writing, editing, and publishing experience by allowing content creators to see their changes as they edit.
* **Streamlined interface.** Blocks unify multiple interfaces (widgets, shortcodes, sidebars) on different screens. The project roadmap for blocks is to lay the foundation for full-page editing and customization.
* **Based on modern development tools.** Designed using JavaScript (React), uses build tools, and leverages the WordPress REST API.
* **Reduces need for advanced code skills.** Site users can create complex layouts using blocks without needing to get web developers to customize the code in the theme or create specific templates.
* **Reduces time to create pages.** With advanced blocks, graphic designers and web developers no longer have to design and create all templates for users in advance. They can create components to give users the choice to create complex layouts. .
> *TerminalFour has no drag and drop page builder so complex layouts, atomically designed blocks, flexibility over block placement, etc. are not possible.*

## Taxonomy support
* Taxonomies such as tags, categories, etc. are a requirement for robust **news**, **blogs**, **spotlights**, and **archives**.
* Taxonomies are also a requirement for better SEO.
> *TerminalFour does not have taxonomy support. TerminalFour customers rely on WordPress for taxonomy support, blogs, etc.*

## Restful API
* All data in WordPress can be accessed via an API in JSON for **applications**, **search tools**, etc. without any extra work.
> *TerminalFour customers have no API to get data in or out. This has negative impacts on search capabilities, external application needs, and displaying data from one of your sites on other sites with ease.*

## Search engine optimization
* **WordPress has advanced SEO plugins.** This helps site owners’ complete control over how pages appear in search results and helps department pages to rank higher for certain search terms.
* [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wordpress-best-cms-seo/338275/#close) – 10 reason why WordPress is the best CMS for SEO.
* WordPress dominates search engine results pages (SERPs) for [CMS’s](https://www.gotchseo.com/best-cms-for-seo/).
* **Yoast SEO plugin** has had millions of downloads worldwide because it makes website SEO optimization simple for even the least tech-savvy person. Helps you optimize the content you write with your focus keyword. Assists you in creating content that’s readable for both humans and search engine spiders. Provides SEO title and meta description templating. Offers Premium users full support and there are Yoast employees in Gainesville we could consult with if needed.
> *TerminalFour does not have the robust SEO admin features offered by the Yoast or other SEO plugin providers at this time.*

## Accessibility
* **WordPress will be accessible by default.** According to the WordPress Accessibility coding standards. “All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA.”
* **WordPress has an Accessibility Team actively working on issues.** In May 2019, Tenon, completed an accessibility audit of the interface on behalf of WPCampus. They identified and reported major issues. More than half have already been closed.

## Plugins
* Just like your smart phone experience is enhanced with apps. Your CMS page building experience is enhanced by plugins.
* There are over 50,000 free and premium plugins to choose from. You name it and there is a plugin that can do it.
* Examples – **calendars**, **forms**, **eCommerce**, **events**, and **SEO** to name but a few.
> *TerminalFour does not have 1,000’s of plugins to choose from to fill missing features and functionality.*

## Robust forms
* The Gravity Forms plugin is incredibly powerful. 30+ form fields. Drag and drop UI. Conditional logic. Pre-populated form fields based on UF person data and URL parameters. The list goes on and on.
> *TerminalFour has no robust form engine. TerminalFour customers rely on WordPress for robust forms.*

## Publish times & instant preview
* WordPress allows you to publish pages instantly.
> *TerminalFour takes minutes to publish pages.*

## Local talent & hiring talent
* There are approximately 10 TerminalFour developers across campus.
* There are over approximately 40 WordPress developers across campus.
* 40 developers can accomplish more than 10 developers when it comes to contributing to new modules, features, bug fixes, etc. for the .EDU Next Generation theme.
* Finding developers with TerminalFour experience is challenging.
* Finding developers with WordPress experience is easy.

## Resources and help
Mastering a CMS deeply requires an abundance of learning resources and helpful documentation to get you through all the gotchas.
* **WordCamps** – 1016 camps, 75 cities, 65 countries, 6 continents.
* **Meetups** – 1,666 groups, 787,565 members, 66 countries, 535 cities.
* **LinkedIn Learning** – WordPress search produces 74 courses, 2006 videos, 3 learning paths. TerminalFour search produces nothing.

* **Google video** – WordPress search produces 276,000,000. TerminalFour search produces 5,090.
* **Google** – WordPress search returns 2,110,000,000 results. TerminalFour search returns 238,000.

> *TerminalFour does not provide near the learning opportunities WordPress does.*

## Astonishing Facts
WordPress powers sites such as TED, NBC, CNN, TechCrunch, Mashable, People Magazine, the NFL, Best Buy, CBS Radio, UPS, New York Post, USA Today, Fortune, Time, National Post, Spotify, and the list goes on…

* **WordPress** powers 35% of the internet.
* **WordPress** powers over 60% of all CMS sites and the next in line is 4.5%.
* **WordPress** total estimated cost to build is estimated to be 382 person years or $21,036,446 dollars with over a million lines of code.
* **WordPress** has more than 50,000 free plugins and 1,000’s of premium plugins.
* **WordPress** powers 27% of all online stores using the WooCommerce plugin.
* **WordPress** is still the fastest growing CMS with 500+ new sites added daily in the top 10 million sites.

## Security
**The WordPress Security Team is made up of approximately 50 experts including lead developers and security researchers —** about half are employees of Automattic (makers of WordPress.com, the earliest and largest WordPress hosting platform on the web), and a number work in the web security field. The team consults with well-known and trusted security researchers and hosting companies.

* WordPress plugins get hacked when not updated
* WordPress core gets hacked when not updated
* WordPress login gets brute forced when not protected by SAML
* WordPress database credentials get compromised due to improper file permissions
> *TerminalFour shines on security. Static sites are hard to hack. Hackers don't target TerminalFour because the CMS powers less than 1% of CMS market share while WordPress powers over 60% of all CMS sites.*

**The 80/20 rule works well here. More than 80% of hacks are prevented by just simply keeping core updated, plugins updated, your admin login protected, and your files set with proper permissions.** Once a vulnerability is detected and fixed it is made public. Once public, hackers get to work on exploiting the vulnerability. If you don’t update promptly to address the vulnerability you eventually get hacked. The remaining issues are easily addressed through table prefixes, protecting wp-login, wise plugin choices, etc.

**Additionally, with a bit of effort you can deploy static sites in WordPress just like TerminalFour. This is the same level of security as TerminalFour.** Because what is served to the world is a static site not connected to a database. No dynamic code, no database, and therefore no vulnerabilities. The problem with this approach is you lose some functionality.
